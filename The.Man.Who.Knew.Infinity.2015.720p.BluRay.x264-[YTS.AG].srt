1
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,643
I have to form myself,
as I have never really formed before,

2
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:37,805
and try to help you to form
some sort of reasoned estimate

3
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:42,010
of the most romantic figure
in the recent history of mathematics.

4
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,806
Ramanujan was an Indian,

5
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,605
and I suppose
that it is always a little difficult

6
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,890
for an Englishman and an Indian
to understand one another properly.

7
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,400
I owe more to him
than to anyone else in the world,

8
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:07,691
and my association with him
is the one romantic incident of my life.

9
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,970
He was, in a way, my discovery.

10
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,085
I did not invent him.

11
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,643
Like other great men, he invented himself.

12
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,605
The difficulty for me, then,

13
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:34,321
is not that I do not know
enough about him,

14
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,768
but that I know and feel too much.

15
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:01,248
You can also see I've been conducting
my own mathematical researches.

16
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,127
You've no degree. You're unemployable.

17
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,682
I'll write you a recommendation.
Maybe someone...

18
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,650
With all due respect, sir,
I have recommendations.

19
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,411
What I need is a job.

20
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:15,005
- Please. I have a wife.
- You people are all the same.

21
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,082
Now get out. Now!

22
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,289
I'm doomed, like Galileo.

23
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,725
He died in poverty, you know.

24
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,121
At least you hold yourself in good esteem.

25
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,483
Whatever is written in your fate
will happen. You can't change that.

26
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,722
My fate is to have a wife
who lives with my mother

27
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:50,010
while I sleep here with you all because
the British think I'm a raving lunatic.

28
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,971
As do we Indians.

29
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,645
Where did you get your degree?

30
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,245
I don't have one.

31
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,888
- How many do you have?
- None.

32
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,445
- Who else have you shown this to?
- Everyone.

33
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:46,002
The British. The Indians.
They all send me to someone else.

34
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,570
I can offer you a job,

35
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,049
but your evenings will have to be spent
in helping me understand this.

36
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,560
A job?

37
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,849
- Do we have an agreement?
- Yes.

38
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,403
- Most certainly, sir.
- Good.

39
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,645
Send for your wife so you can be together.

40
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,131
And put this on.

41
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,365
Follow me.

42
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,645
Sir Francis, here are today's ledgers.

43
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,529
And our new clerk.

44
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,201
Narayana, how long have you worked for me?

45
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,125
Since I helped to design
the bridge on the Godavari,

46
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,090
which now requires me to call you "Sir".

47
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,885
Sir Francis.

48
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,281
This man looks as if
he lives on the streets.

49
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,601
- Get him out of here.
- Sir, please.

50
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:38,765
Forgive my appearance, but I really am
quite exceptional with numbers.

51
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,842
What you might see now is ordinary glass,

52
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:44,083
I promise you will soon remain
to see a diamond.

53
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,246
Well...

54
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,926
Your accounts had better be
half as polished as your ego.

55
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,008
Amma, this is it.

56
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,282
It's the best I could do for now.

57
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,291
It's a home.

58
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,326
Please.

59
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,250
Where is the kitchen?

60
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,291
It's inside.

61
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,686
From the wedding.

62
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,284
Don't worry. I will sleep on the floor.

63
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,044
I'm used to it.

64
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,927
I have to go back to work now.

65
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,722
Why aren't you using the abacus?

66
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,090
It was faster in my head.

67
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,246
Impressive.

68
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,882
If Sir Francis comes here,
at least pretend to use this.

69
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:05,483
I see you've been working
on your own formulas.

70
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,282
Paper is a precious commodity here.

71
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,886
You'll find plenty of packing
down at the docks.

72
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,130
Thank you, sir.

73
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,765
See you tonight.

74
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,804
Ramanujan,

75
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,760
we need to seek an audience with someone

76
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,286
who really understands all this.

77
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:41,287
I've been to everyone in Madras.

78
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,960
Madras.

79
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,764
Did you know that the name
derives from Mandarajya?

80
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,481
"The realm of the stupid."

81
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,806
There's a whole world out there.

82
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,729
And there's England.

83
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,200
You don't come home.

84
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:10,203
It is I who owe the apology
for keeping him.

85
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,486
I think it's enough
for tonight, Ramanujan.

86
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,805
I'm sorry.

87
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:32,127
I was told you love numbers
more than people.

88
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,641
Some.

89
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,407
Not you.

90
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,246
Perhaps we can start over.

91
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,367
I am Ramanujan.

92
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,449
And I am your wife.

93
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,645
Go ahead. You can look.

94
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,360
Please.

95
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,363
What does it all do?

96
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,246
It's like a painting, I think.

97
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:37,728
Only imagine it is with
colors you cannot see.

98
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,530
What good is that?

99
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,441
Not much for you, I'm afraid.

100
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:47,126
But for me it is everything.

101
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:53,649
Maybe there is someone else who can
see and understand it as well.

102
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,761
And for them it will be important.

103
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,130
Have you met them?

104
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,210
No. Not yet.

105
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:14,845
I want to understand
more than just colors I can't see.

106
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,731
What do you see?

107
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,364
- Sand.
- Yes.

108
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,444
Imagine, if we could look so closely,
we could see each grain,

109
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,964
each particle.

110
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:37,282
You see, there are...
There are patterns in everything.

111
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,089
The color in light.

112
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,763
The reflections on water.

113
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,645
In maths, these patterns reveal themselves

114
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,563
in the most incredible form.

115
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,963
It's quite beautiful.

116
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,125
You should sleep in the bed.

117
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,845
Amma.

118
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,331
I have made a friend in my boss.

119
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,528
He's going to find somebody
to understand my work outside Madras.

120
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,641
- Outside India.
- That is an honor.

121
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,689
What nonsense are you talking?

122
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,687
Amma, he sees something in me.

123
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,285
He surely sees enough of you.

124
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,442
You're never here at home.

125
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,443
Kanna, we are Brahmins.

126
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,169
It is forbidden to cross the seas.

127
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,691
Ramanujan?

128
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,362
Ramanujan, listen to me.

129
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,240
This work is too important
to die with you.

130
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,129
It must be published.

131
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:11,282
If you, an Indian,
are at the pinnacle with these formulas,

132
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,204
then the British,
even while they subjugate us,

133
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:17,602
must recognize
that our brightest matches theirs.

134
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,170
Anna, please.

135
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,001
I can't.

136
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:25,688
You have been alone in your mind
your whole life.

137
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,440
Now other people have the chance
to understand you.

138
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,010
Not just your Namagiri.

139
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,851
- Imagine.
- All I do is imagine.

140
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,767
These first two letters...

141
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,880
Baker.

142
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,246
Hobson.

143
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,965
And who's this?

144
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:07,931
That's... That's Hardy.
He's a real pot stirrer.

145
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:14,122
You know, he single-handedly reformed
the entire Tripos examination system.

146
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:18,284
Turned over hundreds of years of history.

147
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,930
He's your man.

148
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,090
Trinity?

149
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,602
Kings, prime ministers.

150
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,002
Isaac Newton. Byron.

151
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,604
Now perhaps even you.

152
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,368
Trouble on the Continent?

153
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,883
There will be.

154
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:54,245
We beat the Frogs by a goal at Twickenham.

155
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,084
I meant in the Balkans.

156
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,565
The Balkans.

157
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:03,008
You've got one there
seems particularly well traveled.

158
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,327
Do you think it's another hoax?

159
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:27,085
"I beg to introduce myself
as a clerk in the Accounts Department."

160
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,285
- What this time?
- Quite impressive, really.

161
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,488
Someone's gone to a lot of trouble.

162
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,964
A Hindu clerk!

163
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,565
And who claims he can give meaning

164
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:40,564
to the negative values
of the gamma function.

165
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,882
- Littlewood?
- Without doubt.

166
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,249
You know, Littlewood,

167
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,885
this year alone,
I've received correspondence

168
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,165
from those who profess

169
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:56,125
to prove the prophetic wisdom
of the Pyramids,

170
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,522
the revelations of the Elders of Zion,

171
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,322
and the cryptograms,
which Bacon supposedly buried

172
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:07,205
within the plays
of the so-called Shakespeare.

173
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:15,605
But a letter from
an ill-educated Indian clerk in Madras,

174
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,969
challenging assertions I made in the
tracts series, really takes the biscuit.

175
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,249
Well, I have to say,
I've made similar assertions myself.

176
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,051
So you admit it?

177
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,641
But this was three years ago.

178
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,327
No, no, no. I'm talking about the letter.

179
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,965
Bloody brilliant, I thought. I don't know
where you got the postmark.

180
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,884
Almost had me fooled.

181
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,164
I simply don't know
what you're talking about.

182
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:43,083
Come on. I'm not a complete idiot.

183
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:48,365
I don't know how to get this
into your thick skull,

184
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:51,330
but whatever it is you're talking about,

185
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,808
I'm simply not involved.

186
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,686
Play.

187
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,647
Sir.

188
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,964
You've missed Hall.

189
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,405
Not hungry.

190
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:24,130
I tell you, there is a war coming,
no doubt about it.

191
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:28,885
Because we are being led
like mindless, spineless sheep

192
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,725
and no one bothers to question any of it.

193
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,122
It's coming, all right. You can smell it.

194
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,885
You're as paranoid as Hardy.

195
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,405
With all due respect, Bertie,
you couldn't hold a candle.

196
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,289
Littlewood, could I have a word?

197
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,645
Yes, of course.

198
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,205
Integrals.

199
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,566
Infinite series.

200
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,649
God knows what else.

201
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,485
Excuse me.

202
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,605
I always forget
you don't believe in a supreme being.

203
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,725
Right.

204
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,925
If this chap turns out to be genuine,
you might have to reconsider.

205
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,325
He must be genuine.

206
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,925
Who would have the imagination
to invent all that?

207
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,367
Well, I'm rather flattered
you thought I did.

208
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:09,081
These two infinite series
are the more intriguing.

209
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,924
Yeah. They defeated me completely.

210
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,445
I've never seen anything like them.

211
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,170
Well, it's deceptive.

212
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,690
I'll wager the hypergeometric series.

213
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,768
Our great Littlewood, stumped.

214
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,648
He's Hobbs class, I'd say.

215
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:30,240
"Being inexperienced, I would very
highly value any advice you give me.

216
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,210
"Yours truly, S. Ramanujan."

217
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:37,202
- What does the "S" stand for?
- You can ask him yourself.

218
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:40,848
- You intend to invite him here?
- Well, no, no, no, no, no.

219
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:45,045
Much better, let him rot away
in his office in Madras?

220
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,845
Mr. Ramanujan.

221
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,125
There seems to be a letter for you.

222
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,010
Postmarked England. Cambridge, England.

223
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,331
From a Mr. G. H. Hardy.

224
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,091
I used to come here
and watch the boats leaving.

225
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,721
I always wondered what it would be like
to be on one of them.

226
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:19,409
I'm finally here
and you talk of crossing the sea?

227
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,643
It is forbidden for us.

228
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,969
I don't understand.

229
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,651
If you go, it will never be the same.

230
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,328
This is not Calcutta or Bombay.

231
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,165
No one will marry our children.
No one will even talk to us!

232
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,925
Then we will move to Calcutta or Bombay.

233
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:42,643
Besides, I don't want to
talk to anyone but you.

234
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,689
Do you promise to bring me
as soon as you are able?

235
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,447
Yes.

236
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,121
Then that is what we will do.

237
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:20,006
Are you sure you want me to do it?

238
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,320
Cut it.

239
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,605
You cut your hair.

240
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,364
What have you done?

241
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:17,887
Amma, I've decided to go to England.

242
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:19,965
Did you?

243
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:24,728
Or did she convince you? So that both
of you could run away together?

244
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,682
This is all her doing.

245
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,202
She wants you all to herself.

246
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,010
Please look after each other
while I'm gone.

247
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,368
Never forget your prayers.

248
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,761
You cannot pollute yourself
with their food,

249
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:21,411
if you ever want to come back.

250
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,203
Don't forget me.

251
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,850
I could never.

252
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,965
I promise.

253
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,164
Well, off we go.

254
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:31,684
6,000 miles. Can you imagine?

255
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,682
I've known larger numbers.

256
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,605
Don't let it ruin your big day
with Gunga Din.

257
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,364
I'm sure it won't mean war.

258
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,520
All this Din, Din, Din.

259
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:14,122
Are you Ramanujan, by chance?

260
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,804
Very much by chance.

261
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,443
Hello. Sorry.

262
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,801
John Littlewood. Such a pleasure.

263
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,281
I was just on my way to meet you.

264
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,562
Well, shall we go together?

265
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,486
Yes.

266
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,244
The intended effect.

267
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,609
Don't be intimidated.

268
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,881
Great knowledge often comes
from the humblest of origins.

269
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,405
Come along.

270
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,611
You see that sapling?

271
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,201
That's the very tree
under which Newton sat,

272
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:06,762
when the apple dropped on his head
and he invented gravity.

273
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:11,680
This way. We've been anticipating
your arrival for some time.

274
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,485
Well, I think it's criminal.

275
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:16,643
I mean, we bring these Indians over at
great expense and look what happens.

276
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,281
Yeah, well, it's not just
that this chap is Ramjin,

277
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,567
whatever his name is, is Indian.

278
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:25,366
After all,
we do have Indian students here.

279
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,885
Just not ones
with no education to speak of.

280
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,685
It's a disgrace.

281
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,001
Ramanujan is a special case.

282
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,965
Why is that, exactly?

283
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,525
We've all read his letter.

284
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,443
There are no proofs.

285
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:40,008
Are we just supposed
to take him at his word?

286
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:41,841
No.

287
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,970
You're to take him at mine.

288
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,764
Change, gentlemen.

289
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,525
It's a wonderful thing.

290
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,806
Embrace it.

291
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:01,129
Take it as a sign of respect
to quieten this lot.

292
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,924
Is Mr. Hardy here?

293
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,122
I'm most excited to meet him.

294
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,363
He must be a very kind man
to bring me all this way.

295
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,450
Speak of the devil.

296
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,280
Hello.

297
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,401
I'm Hardy.

298
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,646
Welcome to Trinity, Mr. Ramanujan.

299
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,527
- Am I pronouncing that properly?
- Yes, sir.

300
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,001
Perfectly.

301
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,089
It's an honor, sir.

302
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,885
Thank you.

303
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:36,445
I very much look forward
to beginning our work.

304
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:42,851
So, tomorrow, 10:00, my rooms.
I look forward to it.

305
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,849
Did I say something wrong?

306
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,320
Don't worry.

307
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,451
I'll look out for you.

308
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,961
That's if you believe he actually exists.

309
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,285
You see, there's speculation
that Mr. Littlewood here

310
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:01,569
is merely a figment
of Hardy's imagination.

311
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:06,003
If he ever makes a mistake,
he'll have someone else to blame.

312
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,850
Ramanujan, Bertrand Russell.

313
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:10,765
- Welcome to our little asylum.
- Hello.

314
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,683
Come along, come along.

315
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,964
Get off the grass!

316
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,891
It's for Fellows only!

317
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:37,243
Excuse me, sir.
Could you direct me to New Court?

318
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,649
- To Mr. Hardy?
- Through there.

319
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,329
You have something on your forehead.

320
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,611
Thank you.

321
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,121
The shoes, they hurt my feet.

322
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,810
Sorry I'm late.

323
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:05,243
You see, you do exist.

324
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,766
Yes.

325
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,286
Right.

326
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:15,003
Ramanujan, we've decided that
for the good of everybody

327
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:17,526
you should attend some lectures.

328
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,449
But I'm here to publish.

329
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:24,326
Yes. All in good time, I hope.

330
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,451
But first we need proofs of your work.

331
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,046
It's really nothing to worry about.

332
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:37,085
It's simply a question of acquainting you
with the more formal methods

333
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,885
that will benefit our future work together.

334
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,689
I mean, we need a common language.

335
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:45,125
You wouldn't expect us to converse
with you in Tamil.

336
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,363
No. But you expect me to speak English.

337
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,201
Quite.

338
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,728
So, there will be plenty of time
for publishing.

339
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:00,209
I'm sorry, but with all humility,
how does anyone know that?

340
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,202
I don't want this to die with me.

341
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:06,041
I assure you it won't.

342
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,883
Thank you, sir.
But I have much more to share with you.

343
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:14,565
As I told you, the letter only contained
a small sampling of my discoveries.

344
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,642
You'll see I have even found a function

345
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,963
which exactly represents the number
of prime numbers less than X

346
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,963
in the form of an infinite series.

347
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,885
- Exactly?
- Yes.

348
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:28,284
I thought if we were going to publish,
it should be something ground-breaking.

349
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:33,049
This is most unexpected.

350
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:45,446
Hardy. This will take a lifetime.

351
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,131
Maybe two.

352
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:24,130
It's quite alarming to see you
so thoroughly pleased with yourself.

353
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,568
Can't have anything to do
with these notebooks, can it?

354
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:32,805
You could spend the rest of your life
trying to prove half of it

355
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,406
and never have
another original idea of your own.

356
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:36,926
Bertie.

357
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:42,203
If I could prove, by logic,
that you are gonna die in five minutes,

358
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,005
I'd be sorry,

359
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,401
but my sorrow would be very much mitigated

360
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,324
by the pleasure in the proof.

361
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:54,530
Might get your wish granted
with half the Continent up in flames

362
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,007
and old men like that running the show.

363
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,161
No.

364
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:02,802
No, you're just a bit sore because you're
worried he'll be up there before you are.

365
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:06,125
I doubt a dark face
will ever grace these walls,

366
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,089
let alone become a Fellow.

367
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,688
Ramanujan! Over here!

368
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,931
Come over, sit with us.

369
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,445
Welcome to Hall.

370
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,806
- I'm Chandra Mahalanobis.
- Hello.

371
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,081
And this is Andrew Hartley.

372
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,366
I am Ramanujan.

373
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,489
Well, everyone knows who you are, mate.

374
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,128
Word's out you've taken on
the prime number theorem.

375
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,887
It is quite extraordinary,
them bringing you here like this.

376
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,205
Such an honor.

377
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,044
There are other Indians?

378
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,361
A few. You're from the South?

379
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,804
Calcutta myself.

380
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,848
This must be quite a shock for you.

381
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,487
Truth is, you've more in common
than you think.

382
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,125
His father was a schoolteacher.

383
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,005
Not exactly Trinity stock.

384
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,684
Hardy's earned it on his own merits.

385
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,485
It's probably why he's taken to you.

386
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:59,564
- Does he have a wife?
- No.

387
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:02,085
He's married to his work, as they say.

388
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,571
I suppose that means you now.

389
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:08,284
- Stop. He's a vegetarian.
- Very sorry.

390
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,250
Potatoes, sir.

391
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,241
How's that any better?

392
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,561
The potatoes are cooked in lard.

393
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,568
- I'm so sorry.
- Not at all.

394
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,084
But... But I think I will go.

395
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,010
I hope to see you soon.

396
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,451
Ramanujan.

397
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,968
Did you have a good dinner?

398
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:57,446
- They make a fine mutton.
- Yes, sir.

399
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,405
Delicious.

400
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:02,760
And your... Your rooms?

401
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,925
Satisfactory?

402
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,961
I want everything to be to your advantage

403
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:12,089
so that we can be
as productive as possible.

404
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,686
Thank you, sir.

405
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,610
Very nice paper.

406
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,166
Well...

407
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,489
Use it wisely.

408
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:26,810
Well, I'll say good night, then.

409
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:41,603
All right. Now...

410
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,405
You. Are you following this?

411
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,845
Yes, sir. Most excitedly.

412
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,245
But you don't appear to be
taking any notes.

413
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,004
Is there something
you'd like to contribute?

414
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,325
Well, come on, then.

415
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,331
Come on!

416
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:01,370
You'll need the chalk.

417
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:28,562
But I... I hadn't completed that proof.

418
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,046
How do you know?

419
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,804
I don't know.

420
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,211
I just do.

421
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:41,241
Well, gentlemen,
it appears that our time is up.

422
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:43,004
Thank you for your attention.

423
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,406
Not you.

424
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,208
Little wog, let me tell you something.

425
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,246
You don't pull a stunt like that
in my class.

426
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:06,885
You don't belong here and you can tell
your Master Hardy I said as much!

427
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,450
Now, get out!

428
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:34,170
My sacred thread.

429
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,526
It's to help ward off evil spirits.

430
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,447
How did it work with Mr. Howard?

431
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,965
I'm sorry, sir.

432
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,290
I got too excited.

433
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:50,930
Not a word often associated
with his lectures.

434
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:55,048
How did you know that theorem?

435
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,490
It came to me.

436
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,688
Mr. Hardy, I don't understand why
we waste our time

437
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,370
doing all these proofs.

438
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,484
I have the formulas.

439
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:09,445
It's not that I can't see
what you've claimed.

440
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,364
It's that I'm not sure that you know
how you got there

441
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:16,008
or, indeed, that your claims are correct.

442
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,004
There are subtleties which...

443
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,570
But they are right, sir.

444
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,725
I have more important new ideas.

445
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:25,441
Yes, but intuition is not enough.
It has to be held accountable.

446
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:31,330
And a little humility would go a long way.

447
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:42,051
Why do you think they want us to fail?

448
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,485
Because I am Indian.

449
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,562
Well, yeah, there is that.

450
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:52,245
But also because of what we represent.

451
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:57,285
Now, Euler and Jacobi. Who are they?

452
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,886
- Mathematicians.
- Just names to you.

453
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:03,483
Euler was the most productive
mathematician of the 18th century.

454
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:05,562
Most of his work done after he was blind.

455
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,765
Jacobi, like you,
was snatched from obscurity,

456
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:10,161
and was almost as impressive as Euler.

457
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,440
Now, I think you are in their class.

458
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:19,242
What they had in common,
what I see in you, is a love of form.

459
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,243
It's all through your notebooks.

460
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,766
Let me ask you something.

461
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,682
Why do you do it, any of this?

462
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:31,202
Because I have to. I see it.

463
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:34,011
Like Euler. Form for its own sake.

464
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,769
An art unto itself.

465
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:40,691
And, like all art, it reflects truth.

466
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:44,530
It's the only truth I know. It's my church.

467
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:49,165
And you, just as Mozart could hear
an entire symphony in his head,

468
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,123
you dance with numbers to infinity.

469
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:57,325
But this dance, this art, does little
to endear us to certain factions

470
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,205
who see us as mere conjurors.

471
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:03,365
So if we are going to challenge areas
of mathematics that are so well trod,

472
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,647
we cannot afford to be wrong.

473
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:10,883
I need you to attend your lectures,
don't offend your professors,

474
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,405
and keep doing your proofs,

475
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:15,529
otherwise this experiment of ours
will be doomed to failure.

476
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,251
Come with me.

477
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,008
I wanna show you something.

478
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:25,085
There are many ways to be honored in life.

479
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:28,929
For us, being elected a Fellow
is certainly one,

480
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:33,366
but in my humble opinion,

481
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:40,368
to leave a legacy,
here at the Wren after we're gone,

482
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,050
is the greatest.

483
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:47,366
This library houses
the Epistles of Saint Paul,

484
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,683
the poems of Milton,

485
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:53,210
Morgan's Bible.

486
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:58,003
But in my estimation, as a man of numbers,

487
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:03,883
the pièce de résistance
is Newton's Principia Mathematica.

488
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,963
Now, just as Newton represents
the physical aspect of our work,

489
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:12,691
your notebooks represent the abstract.

490
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:16,445
Took a long time for Newton to be proved.

491
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:20,405
Which is why we have an obligation
to prove these.

492
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:24,007
And if we do, I believe that one day...

493
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:29,611
One day these notebooks
will find their place here.

494
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:34,450
Now, do you understand
what's at stake here?

495
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,521
Good.

496
00:41:56,680 --> 00:42:01,481
I hope you are taking care of yourself
and that Mr. Hardy is good to you.

497
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:05,045
Everyone here is so proud of you.

498
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,687
But most proud of all is me.

499
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:10,202
I spend every day missing you,

500
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:12,325
and waiting for your letter to tell me

501
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,290
I'm coming to be with you
across the ocean.

502
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:17,369
You are my everything.

503
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,206
I've discovered a new series.

504
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:16,765
Look, I'm not interested in a new series.

505
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:20,003
I thought I'd explained this.
I need your proofs.

506
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:21,366
We had an agreement.

507
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,848
Just, please, look at it, sir. It is true.

508
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:26,805
- How do you know that?
- Because it is written.

509
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,609
Written where, Ramanujan?

510
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:36,404
Now, take my coat, go home and get
properly dressed before you freeze.

511
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,125
Sir, I've come a very long way to be here.

512
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,885
And you promised to help me publish.

513
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:01,122
Don't look at me like that.
It's for his own good.

514
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:04,722
You wouldn't think he's so bloody smart
by the way he dresses.

515
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,807
What the devil is that, anyway?

516
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:09,845
Partitions.

517
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,370
No, no, no, wait.

518
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:18,209
This even you could understand.

519
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:25,084
P of 4 equals 5.

520
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:28,885
Now, all that means is there are
five ways to add up the number 4.

521
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:31,122
1 + 1 + 1 + 1,

522
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,565
3 + 1,

523
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:34,564
2 + 1 + 1,

524
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:38,166
2 + 2, and 4.

525
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,011
Seems simple enough.

526
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:43,365
Yeah. So it does.

527
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:46,444
But when you raise the number of P to 100,

528
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:52,166
there are 204,226 different combinations.

529
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:57,129
Major MacMahon did it by hand.
Took him weeks.

530
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:03,130
And now he thinks
he can figure out a formula.

531
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:05,923
Plug in the number, any number,

532
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,288
and out comes the number of partitions.
Like magic.

533
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:12,925
I take it you have tried
to crack this one before?

534
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,890
It's considered impossible. Unsolvable.

535
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:19,210
A bloody rabbit hole mystery
of the universe.

536
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:20,401
Until now?

537
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:23,370
"Din! Din! Din! Gunga Din."

538
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:57,611
So, using the divergence theorem,

539
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:03,570
what is the flux of F through S here?

540
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:17,690
What on earth's he doing?

541
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:21,889
- Proofs. Yeah.
- Proofs?

542
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,521
You should let him run, Hardy.

543
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:27,809
You shouldn't stifle him.

544
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:45,763
He's gone to the cricket.

545
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:48,207
Just follow the umbrella.

546
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:56,046
Sir!

547
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,811
Mr. Hardy!

548
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:04,805
Mr. Hardy.

549
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:11,923
I've been over those proofs of yours,
if you can call them that, very carefully.

550
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:14,284
And I've marked where you're missing steps

551
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:16,283
and where you've made mistakes.

552
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:19,211
There's much more I could say,
but that's where you should begin.

553
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:23,205
Listen, I'm hard on you
for your own benefit.

554
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:25,965
- So that you can be published.
- But, sir, you can publish the notebooks

555
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:28,122
and my prime number theorem.
You've had them since I arrived.

556
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:30,205
There is nothing I'd like more.
But, if I was to publish them

557
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:33,165
in their present state,
I'd be sent to the lunatic asylum.

558
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:35,322
You don't understand. These...

559
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:37,165
I don't think about this
the same way you do.

560
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:39,083
These steps you want, what you want,

561
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:40,285
I do not know how to do.

562
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:43,485
Well, you can just begin
by trying your best

563
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:45,801
and see if you don't surprise yourself.

564
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:54,010
- Sir, do you know something I don't?
- Apparently not.

565
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:57,763
No, God and I
don't see exactly eye to eye.

566
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:01,565
So if I prepare for rain, then it won't.

567
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:02,885
So far, so good.

568
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:06,405
I'm Hardy and I'm spending
the afternoon in the Wren Library.

569
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,642
Now we're sure to have sunshine.

570
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:12,644
You see, I'm what you call an atheist.

571
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:14,961
No, sir. You believe in God.

572
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:17,168
You just don't think He likes you.

573
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:19,006
Really?

574
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:23,326
Listen.

575
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:27,642
I wasn't gonna give you this just yet,

576
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:33,011
but I took the liberty
of doing some of your proofs myself.

577
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:36,844
Just to show you what together
we can achieve.

578
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:38,606
See?

579
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:41,129
You've been published.

580
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:52,810
Mr. Hardy, thank you!

581
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,525
Thank you, sir!

582
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:11,566
It is with great pride
that today all of us have shared

583
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:17,370
the publication of my son's article
in the London Mathematical Society.

584
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:23,887
Such a big thing.
A very prestigious society.

585
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:31,285
So how really is the little genius?

586
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:35,245
Don't pay attention to her.

587
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:38,130
She's not proud enough
of his achievements.

588
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:53,085
Ramanujan?

589
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:57,765
Wake up. It just came over the wire.
We're at war.

590
00:49:57,840 --> 00:49:59,922
- Here?
- No, silly, Belgium.

591
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,241
Now, come on! The King's arriving!

592
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:05,804
God save the King!

593
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:10,844
Bloody jingoes.

594
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:12,965
Bertie's asked me to help him

595
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:16,405
with his Union of Democratic Control
or something.

596
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:19,165
- Agitating already?
- Well...

597
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:24,049
Well, I received a letter
from the War Office this morning.

598
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:27,763
Seems they need some assistance
with ballistics.

599
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:29,405
- Ballistics? You?
- I know.

600
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:32,324
I did try to explain,
but they're rather a dense lot.

601
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:34,442
- Yeah.
- Anyway, you probably won't miss me.

602
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:37,444
There's an ongoing theory that I'm
merely a figment of your imagination.

603
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:39,204
That's not true.

604
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:42,129
Ramanujan's out there.

605
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:46,531
There's a reason
he doesn't like proofs, you know.

606
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:49,844
They may be disagreeable to his formulas.

607
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:52,446
- God save the King!
- How do you mean?

608
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:56,605
Well, I've been having some
reservations about some of his work.

609
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:58,762
Well, what did you expect?

610
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:02,049
He may belong to a world beyond us,
but he's not God.

611
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:04,003
Well, that's a relief.

612
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:05,766
He's not.

613
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:11,645
How will Janaki ever come now?

614
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:14,849
Don't worry.
They say it'll be over by Christmas.

615
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:21,891
Please finish by telling him
that, of course, I will come

616
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:26,007
and not to worry about the war.
It is far away from here.

617
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:32,401
And that I will wait for him to make
the necessary arrangements.

618
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:37,969
Also that I love him very much.

619
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:43,486
That is all.

620
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:47,846
Make your mark here.

621
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:52,969
I knew your husband.

622
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:55,682
But he spent all the time at the temple.

623
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:58,920
He's still there in the alcove.

624
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:01,246
Amma?

625
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:05,530
Amma, please, would you post this for him?

626
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:10,650
He needs to know
I will still come with the war.

627
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:21,247
Amma, please let me help you.

628
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:20,168
- Where are all the vegetables?
- Rationing for the war.

629
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:26,804
And some... Thank you.

630
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:29,450
There is no letter for you.

631
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:31,725
Please, can you check again?

632
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:33,404
I already looked again.

633
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:35,365
Now, you're holding up the queue.

634
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:37,442
His mum forgot to write him.

635
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:45,046
Look who it is, the genius wog!

636
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:48,962
Can you believe they send us off
while he kips here in luxury?

637
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:52,645
Where do you think you're going?

638
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:54,605
You freeloading little blackie.

639
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:56,125
Hey. Hey.

640
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:57,964
I'm talking to you.

641
00:54:58,040 --> 00:54:59,121
Hey.

642
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:07,009
This is our home.

643
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:09,884
Don't you forget it.

644
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:39,249
Victory at any price?

645
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:42,010
Victory for whom?

646
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:46,004
I understand it's inevitable

647
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:48,645
that anybody primarily interested in peace

648
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:52,520
should be unpopular in a time of war.

649
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:58,965
But perhaps that is all the more reason
that we should exist.

650
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:01,042
Hear, hear.

651
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:04,370
Mr. Littlewood has very kindly
offered us his rooms

652
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:08,121
while he is away solving
the intricacies of ballistics

653
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:11,727
for which he is so ill-suited.

654
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:15,360
So please keep your hands off my books.

655
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:17,681
By that he means his whiskey collection.

656
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:20,844
Thank you all very much for coming.

657
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:22,684
Bless you.

658
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:25,531
Thank you so much. Thank you for coming.

659
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:35,690
Bloody cheek!

660
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:39,808
...were so fast and ours were in
completely the wrong position.

661
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:42,249
What is the meaning of this?

662
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:44,961
I'd have thought
you'd choose your battles more wisely.

663
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:48,005
After all, it's only the goodwill
of the college that allows Ramujin here.

664
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:51,641
What the bloody hell does the UDC
have to do with Ramanujan?

665
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:54,564
You should know that your friend,
Russell, is going to lose his lectureship

666
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:56,365
as a result of the leaflets
he's been distributing.

667
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:59,046
We have heard that others
are doing the same.

668
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:03,605
Are you threatening me?

669
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:07,321
Mr. Howard is simply trying
to enlighten you

670
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:10,768
as to the precariousness
of your situation.

671
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:14,965
You are perfectly at liberty to take
the matter to the College Council.

672
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:17,288
Well, rest assured, I shall, on principle.

673
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:18,805
Well, that's a rather dangerous word,

674
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:21,360
with all your liberal colleagues
in France.

675
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:23,565
Change, Hardy. That's what you wanted.

676
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:25,409
Now you get used to it.

677
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:39,042
From Mr. Littlewood, sir.

678
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:46,805
If I may,
he's so misplaced on a battlefield,

679
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:50,009
I shouldn't think a bullet
would recognize him as a target.

680
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:01,044
Damn you, Littlewood.

681
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:09,602
My dear Harold, please forgive
this personal transgression.

682
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:13,323
I'm gone now to this god-awful war

683
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:16,649
and haven't the faintest idea
if I will ever return.

684
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:22,491
Fortunately, unlike you,
I do have God to take comfort in.

685
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:26,123
I have two points to make.

686
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:30,125
The first is that
Ramanujan's work on primes,

687
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:33,602
while brilliant in itself, is actually wrong.

688
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:36,961
The other point is less straightforward.

689
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:40,687
You have in Ramanujan
nothing short of a miracle.

690
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:43,845
The man exceeds any notion of brilliance

691
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:45,888
that I have ever understood.

692
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:50,008
Forget Jacobi,
we can compare him with Newton.

693
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:53,605
I have come to believe that for Ramanujan,

694
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:57,651
every single positive integer
is one of his personal friends.

695
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:01,767
And, to that end,
you, too, have a responsibility.

696
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:03,924
You have to look after him

697
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,844
and make sure that his work
amounts to something.

698
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:09,362
Don't let Howard and his lot win.

699
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:13,167
So, you see, Hardy,
you, too, have a war to fight.

700
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:15,966
Just don't let it be with Ramanujan.

701
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:21,288
So, there you have it.

702
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:24,802
He left this for you to see for yourself.

703
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:27,567
Your theorem on primes is wrong.

704
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:32,801
- It's not. It can't be.
- It's rather interesting, really.

705
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:35,645
If you compare
the prime number approximation

706
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:37,045
with the actual number of primes,

707
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:40,085
- the calculation tells us what?
- It always moves higher.

708
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:42,731
Even at a thousand? A million?

709
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:45,404
A billion trillion?

710
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:46,801
Yes?

711
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:51,445
- Where is the proof?
- I gave it to you. It proves it.

712
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:54,603
No, because however
intuitively obvious it may seem,

713
01:00:54,680 --> 01:00:57,160
when subject to calculation, it fails.

714
01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:00,322
Mr. Littlewood has calculated a number

715
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:04,525
and it shows that your theorem
will sometimes predict less,

716
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:07,045
not more,
than the actual number of primes.

717
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:09,009
Your theorem is wrong.

718
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:12,405
And this is why we cannot publish any more

719
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:16,525
until you finally trust me
on this business of proofs.

720
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:19,924
- Intuition can only carry you so far.
- Stop!

721
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:24,607
I... I can't hear this anymore.

722
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:26,205
Intuition?

723
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:28,442
You say this word as if it is nothing.

724
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:31,285
Is that all it is to you? All that I am?

725
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:33,567
Look, I'm sorry.
Am I... I'm missing something.

726
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:39,810
You've... You've never even seen me,
let alone know me.

727
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:42,440
You... You are a man of no faith!

728
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:45,284
I don't see pictures of anyone here!

729
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:47,283
Not even family! Who are you, Mr. Hardy?

730
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:48,930
How dare you...

731
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:51,965
How dare you judge me?

732
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:53,963
But it is you who does of me!
Don't you see?

733
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:55,606
No.

734
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:58,209
Quite frankly, I don't.

735
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:01,642
Don't you know
what I've given up to be here?

736
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:05,650
I have nothing.

737
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:09,486
Do you even see the bruises on my face?

738
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:17,482
I have a wife, Mr. Hardy.

739
01:03:55,160 --> 01:03:56,400
At last.

740
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:06,247
Ramanujan? Is that you?

741
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:09,251
Mr. Hardy.

742
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:12,091
You're not well?

743
01:04:12,680 --> 01:04:13,920
Nothing serious.

744
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:15,366
Sure?

745
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:20,362
I'm just off to the Wren.

746
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:22,241
Believe it or not,

747
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:25,887
if you can find your way round the beds,
there are still some books there.

748
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:31,168
Those proofs you left...

749
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:33,125
Wonderful.

750
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:34,440
Really wonderful.

751
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:38,847
So, we start work again?

752
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:41,164
Tomorrow morning?

753
01:04:42,040 --> 01:04:43,804
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

754
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:58,369
- My regards to your fine wife.
- Thank you so much.

755
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:00,491
Good day, gentlemen.

756
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:02,290
I'm very sorry, sir.

757
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:04,325
He was a fine young man.

758
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:07,728
- Best... Best of his year.
- They were all fine young men.

759
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:10,485
All the knowledge they gained here.

760
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:13,404
Sacrificed for a few yards of land.

761
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:16,846
They say it's the price of victory.

762
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:24,324
Come, Bertie.

763
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,765
I'm worried about Ramanujan.

764
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:32,086
Why?

765
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:36,527
Well, he doesn't seem quite himself.

766
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:40,368
What would you know about that?

767
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:43,770
Very little, I admit.

768
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:47,531
But I don't think he's well.
He seems to have changed.

769
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:53,603
We had a terrible row the other night

770
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:57,725
about intuition, of all things,
and he stormed out.

771
01:05:57,800 --> 01:06:01,361
And then a day later,
he produces these wonderful proofs.

772
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:04,045
Well, Harold, you've got your way.

773
01:06:04,120 --> 01:06:05,690
How do you mean?

774
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:10,167
You and your damned rigor
has finally broken his spirits.

775
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:13,322
I warned you to let him run.

776
01:06:15,240 --> 01:06:16,805
Yeah, well, he's not a bloody racehorse.

777
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:17,881
No, he's not.

778
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:22,281
But as you've hardly treated him
as a human being, I suppose...

779
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:26,043
Well, I suppose a horse
isn't a bad place to start.

780
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:12,442
Major, can I have a word?

781
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:14,443
I don't have time for you!

782
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:16,365
Partitions!

783
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:21,650
It's Ramanujan.

784
01:07:24,360 --> 01:07:25,646
The gall.

785
01:07:25,960 --> 01:07:28,486
The unbridled arrogance.

786
01:07:30,520 --> 01:07:32,284
He won't be able to do it without you.

787
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:34,926
He won't be able to do it at all.

788
01:07:53,720 --> 01:07:56,929
I've been going over
your work on partitions.

789
01:07:57,840 --> 01:08:01,128
Seems to me you're on the verge
of a major breakthrough.

790
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:06,963
So now you've begun
to embrace some proper rigor,

791
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:11,161
I think you should meet Major MacMahon.

792
01:08:11,240 --> 01:08:14,244
He's the leader in combinatorics
at the University,

793
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:17,842
and also happens to be
one of your most vocal opponents.

794
01:08:18,840 --> 01:08:21,241
He says partitions can't be done.

795
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:24,487
Especially by the likes of you.

796
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:30,571
Then he better start counting very high.

797
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:34,963
Enter at your own risk!

798
01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:41,203
I've been waiting for you.

799
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:45,167
Square root of 58,639? Now!

800
01:08:46,120 --> 01:08:47,201
242.

801
01:08:47,280 --> 01:08:48,361
242 what?

802
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:52,329
Point 1549090.

803
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:54,689
Yes, child's play. Try me.

804
01:08:56,080 --> 01:08:57,241
Go on.

805
01:08:59,720 --> 01:09:00,926
Same number squared.

806
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:08,565
3,438,532,321.

807
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:10,645
Thrashed ya!

808
01:09:10,720 --> 01:09:12,605
Combinatorics, that's what I do.

809
01:09:12,680 --> 01:09:14,409
Glorified dice throwing.

810
01:09:17,160 --> 01:09:19,481
Bloody nerve of you both.

811
01:09:20,280 --> 01:09:22,085
You fail on primes, then you think

812
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:24,925
you can just turn round
and crack partitions?

813
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:26,765
Can't be done, I'm telling you.

814
01:09:26,840 --> 01:09:28,888
Especially not by you.

815
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:31,001
It can.

816
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:33,846
And I will.

817
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:37,206
No, I will.

818
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:38,801
By hand.

819
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:43,169
By slow and painful addition,
and then you can be absolutely certain

820
01:09:43,280 --> 01:09:47,569
that whatever formula you two
can dream up will be quite wrong.

821
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:51,685
Then you can crawl back under
whatever rock you came from in India

822
01:09:51,760 --> 01:09:54,889
and we can put to bed
this charade of yours, Hardy.

823
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:58,609
Now, how high do I have to go?

824
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:03,809
P of 200 should do.

825
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:06,930
I really can do it.

826
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:51,802
Well, here we are, P of 200.
The moment of truth.

827
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:55,125
You know, I was stationed in Madras once.

828
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:56,326
Yeah.

829
01:10:57,680 --> 01:10:59,284
Well, you first.

830
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:01,762
What has your formula given you?

831
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:09,004
3,972,998,000,000.

832
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:12,725
My God.

833
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:15,250
You're close.

834
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:20,691
Within 2%.

835
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:25,090
Well, I'll be damned.

836
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:31,967
Major MacMahon,
may I introduce you to Mr. Ramanujan.

837
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:13,085
How long?

838
01:12:13,160 --> 01:12:14,321
Three weeks.

839
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:16,685
And the fever?

840
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:18,125
- Longer.
- Breathe in.

841
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:21,806
Breathe in.

842
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:26,208
Well, it's not good.

843
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:30,124
You've all the early signs of tubercula.

844
01:12:30,240 --> 01:12:31,480
I'm sorry.

845
01:12:32,240 --> 01:12:34,925
You're a breeding ground for infection.

846
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:41,168
I'm so sorry, Ramanujan.

847
01:12:42,440 --> 01:12:44,249
Hardy can never know.

848
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:50,050
Run! Run!

849
01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:53,450
It's a zeppelin!

850
01:12:54,440 --> 01:12:55,441
Come on, Ram!

851
01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:00,565
Over here!

852
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:13,484
I'm being punished.

853
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:15,331
It's just the fever.

854
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:49,010
Has he wrote yet?

855
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:50,761
No.

856
01:13:52,840 --> 01:13:54,604
Where are you going?

857
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:12,370
You forgot me.

858
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:23,970
You see, you were right.

859
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:26,085
Cauchy's theorem will work.

860
01:14:26,160 --> 01:14:27,810
It's just leading to the circle concept.

861
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:34,011
At 2,000, it should bring it down to
less than 1 % or so.

862
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:40,961
And as N goes to infinity,
the error goes to zero.

863
01:14:44,040 --> 01:14:48,405
You see? You're beginning to see
the nuances and complexities,

864
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:51,370
which you were only catching
at a glance before.

865
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:55,321
What an unlikely team we make.

866
01:14:55,480 --> 01:14:59,804
If we really crack partitions, this will
be a monumental breakthrough.

867
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:08,521
Did I tell you I've...
I've put you up for a Fellowship?

868
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:17,525
Mr. Hardy,

869
01:15:19,480 --> 01:15:20,891
thank you.

870
01:15:31,720 --> 01:15:33,290
Are you getting enough to eat?

871
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:35,325
I mean, I know there are shortages,

872
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:37,801
but there's still plenty
of good grub in Hall.

873
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:39,961
I'm all right.

874
01:15:42,280 --> 01:15:43,645
It's nothing.

875
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:47,729
Let me ask you something.

876
01:15:49,080 --> 01:15:51,651
How does all this come to you?

877
01:15:57,840 --> 01:15:59,046
I don't know.

878
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:05,281
Why am I bothering with a Council meeting

879
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:06,964
when I'm getting the boot?

880
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:09,362
If you think I'm gonna have
that charlatan for a Fellow,

881
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:11,124
you're very much mistaken.

882
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:16,080
Please tell me you didn't propose him.

883
01:16:16,160 --> 01:16:18,083
He's gonna crack partitions.

884
01:16:18,160 --> 01:16:19,365
He's worthy.

885
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:22,245
You're the one who told me
to let him run like a damn horse.

886
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:23,765
Well, I did.

887
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:26,844
And now I... I need to raise his spirits.

888
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,924
You mean
you need to relieve your own guilt.

889
01:16:33,680 --> 01:16:36,968
Really, for someone so clever,
you can be so terribly dim.

890
01:16:37,160 --> 01:16:42,200
So, in the matter of Fellowship
for Srinivasa Ramanujan,

891
01:16:42,280 --> 01:16:44,362
we call the matter to vote.

892
01:16:55,240 --> 01:16:57,447
I'm sorry to bother you so late.

893
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:01,886
I felt I should be the one to tell you.

894
01:17:03,400 --> 01:17:07,450
I'm very embarrassed,
for myself and for the College.

895
01:17:08,240 --> 01:17:11,369
But your Fellowship was denied.

896
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:15,929
Thank you for telling me.

897
01:17:16,760 --> 01:17:18,649
I know you did all you could.

898
01:18:29,360 --> 01:18:30,407
Yeah, more dressings!

899
01:18:37,640 --> 01:18:40,120
Can we have someone over here, please?

900
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:45,080
Nurse!

901
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:53,324
- Nurse!
- That's it, just breathe.

902
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:05,040
Ramanujan?

903
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:09,002
Nurse! Nurse!

904
01:19:12,280 --> 01:19:13,930
Shall I wake him?

905
01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:17,207
No.

906
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:21,168
He'll come when he's ready.

907
01:19:37,400 --> 01:19:41,769
Excuse me, Doctor. This gentleman's
looking for the Indian student.

908
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:43,445
Yes.

909
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:45,568
He came in last night.

910
01:19:45,680 --> 01:19:47,125
Not right in the head.

911
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:48,725
Terrible fever.

912
01:19:51,720 --> 01:19:53,085
He was here.

913
01:20:13,720 --> 01:20:15,802
Your condition has worsened.

914
01:20:15,880 --> 01:20:17,928
You may not have long.

915
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:21,166
You should set your affairs in order.

916
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:27,487
Do you have any family here?

917
01:20:28,640 --> 01:20:29,926
Anyone?

918
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:07,011
No!

919
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:13,361
Sir, something's happened in London.

920
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,002
Call me a taxi, will you?

921
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:20,883
He was very lucky with the train.

922
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:23,531
The conductor saw him before he jumped.

923
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:25,922
The danger is his lungs.

924
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,565
Yes, he's had a bad cough for some time.

925
01:21:28,640 --> 01:21:29,765
It is no cough.

926
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:31,649
He has advanced tuberculosis.

927
01:21:39,320 --> 01:21:42,642
Well, is... Is there nothing we could do?

928
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:44,126
Pray.

929
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:46,289
It will take a miracle.

930
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:27,171
Mr. Hardy.

931
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,207
I'm sorry for the trouble I've caused you.

932
01:22:39,040 --> 01:22:40,883
Gave me quite a scare.

933
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:42,724
Self-prophesying.

934
01:22:44,160 --> 01:22:46,481
My wife has forgotten me.

935
01:22:49,160 --> 01:22:50,844
I have no one.

936
01:22:50,920 --> 01:22:54,891
I understand that
you might feel like that,

937
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:58,528
but you should have told me.

938
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:00,484
I could have helped.

939
01:23:36,920 --> 01:23:39,565
You know,
it just as easily could have been me.

940
01:23:39,640 --> 01:23:41,449
Well, I'm glad it wasn't.

941
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:45,166
You have cause enough with Ramanujan.

942
01:23:46,120 --> 01:23:48,282
I'll be thinking of you both.

943
01:23:49,480 --> 01:23:51,164
Where will you go?

944
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:53,442
I'll go down the road to Oxford.

945
01:23:56,240 --> 01:23:59,244
And I'll wait for them
to beg to have me back here.

946
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:03,524
Good-bye, Harold.

947
01:24:03,640 --> 01:24:04,926
Bye, Bertie.

948
01:24:09,640 --> 01:24:12,005
Too bad he couldn't take Hardy with him.

949
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:14,401
I still don't see
what he bloody contributes.

950
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:16,608
Yeah, I had words with Major MacMahon.

951
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:19,963
It seems that Ramanujan's on the verge
of a major breakthrough.

952
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:22,762
That's right. Partitions.

953
01:24:24,440 --> 01:24:26,124
That's impossible.

954
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:28,324
Remains to be seen.

955
01:24:32,680 --> 01:24:35,650
God, it's freezing in here.
Are you warm enough?

956
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:37,405
Try sleeping.

957
01:24:37,480 --> 01:24:40,404
I have to go to that pipe
just so I don't freeze.

958
01:24:41,680 --> 01:24:44,445
It would have been better for all
had the train done its job.

959
01:24:44,520 --> 01:24:48,127
Yeah, you could have been
reincarnated as a pigeon turd.

960
01:24:56,960 --> 01:25:01,284
Sorry I've not been able to be a better
friend to you in the traditional sense.

961
01:25:02,200 --> 01:25:04,965
I know you've needed one,
but I'm not very good at all of that.

962
01:25:05,040 --> 01:25:07,247
I never have been.

963
01:25:08,880 --> 01:25:10,405
Life for me is...

964
01:25:13,120 --> 01:25:15,009
It's always been mathematics.

965
01:25:18,120 --> 01:25:20,691
You wanted to know how I get my ideas.

966
01:25:26,240 --> 01:25:27,526
My God.

967
01:25:29,040 --> 01:25:30,121
Namagiri.

968
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:33,044
She speaks to me.

969
01:25:34,280 --> 01:25:37,284
Puts formulas on my tongue when I sleep,

970
01:25:37,400 --> 01:25:39,243
sometimes when I pray.

971
01:25:42,120 --> 01:25:43,724
Do you believe me?

972
01:25:46,360 --> 01:25:51,207
Because if you are my friend, then you
will know that I'm telling you the truth.

973
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:53,808
If you are truly my friend.

974
01:25:54,200 --> 01:25:57,363
But I don't believe in God.
I don't believe in anything I can't prove.

975
01:25:57,440 --> 01:25:59,408
Then you can't believe in me.

976
01:26:00,920 --> 01:26:02,649
Don't you see?

977
01:26:02,760 --> 01:26:08,085
An equation has no meaning to me
unless it expresses a thought of God.

978
01:26:12,920 --> 01:26:16,083
Maybe it is better
that we just remain what we were.

979
01:26:21,280 --> 01:26:25,126
When I was at school,
I remember one of my chaplains saying,

980
01:26:25,560 --> 01:26:28,404
"You know God exists
because He's like a kite,

981
01:26:28,480 --> 01:26:32,610
"and you can feel the tug on the string
and know that He's up there."

982
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:37,767
I said, "What if there's no wind
and the kite can't fly?"

983
01:26:40,240 --> 01:26:42,447
No, I... I can't believe in God.

984
01:26:43,960 --> 01:26:47,325
I don't believe
in the immemorial wisdom of the East,

985
01:26:47,400 --> 01:26:49,482
but I do believe in you.

986
01:26:53,080 --> 01:26:54,286
Thank you.

987
01:26:57,960 --> 01:27:00,850
I very much want to finish
what we started.

988
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:03,001
Good.

989
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:08,721
I brought some calculations
in case you were feeling a bit better.

990
01:27:09,720 --> 01:27:11,165
And then I want to go home.

991
01:27:13,720 --> 01:27:14,801
Home?

992
01:27:14,880 --> 01:27:16,564
As soon as I am able.

993
01:27:16,640 --> 01:27:20,245
Or if I should die, you have to promise
that you will get me home.

994
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:22,163
You're not going to die.

995
01:27:22,680 --> 01:27:24,250
This came for you.

996
01:27:35,120 --> 01:27:37,088
I'll leave you in peace.

997
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:42,487
Try and do what the doctors ask.
I know it's not in your nature.

998
01:27:54,360 --> 01:27:57,045
I will never know
why you have chosen to forsake me.

999
01:27:57,800 --> 01:27:59,211
Just a letter in response

1000
01:27:59,320 --> 01:28:02,210
to the multitude I have sent you
would have been enough.

1001
01:28:02,640 --> 01:28:06,406
I have gone to be with my brother
and his family where I will remain.

1002
01:28:07,080 --> 01:28:09,560
This last letter is to say good-bye.

1003
01:28:43,320 --> 01:28:46,722
- What happened?
- I don't know. He's a terrible patient.

1004
01:28:46,840 --> 01:28:48,885
Doesn't believe in medicine.
Won't eat anything.

1005
01:28:48,960 --> 01:28:50,325
Just prays to his Namagiri.

1006
01:28:50,400 --> 01:28:54,007
Well, I'd be praying too if you were
my doctor. And I'm a bloody atheist.

1007
01:29:00,600 --> 01:29:04,286
- This is my fault.
- Yes, maybe.

1008
01:29:20,360 --> 01:29:22,761
We are within .004.

1009
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:25,921
This can't die with me, Mr. Hardy.

1010
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:29,603
You're not going to die.

1011
01:29:31,320 --> 01:29:35,006
If this is correct,
you'll make a difference.

1012
01:29:42,120 --> 01:29:44,043
I have the proofs.

1013
01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:48,566
My God.

1014
01:29:49,680 --> 01:29:52,650
He did it. He really did it.

1015
01:29:53,240 --> 01:29:55,049
Now he must be a Fellow.

1016
01:29:55,160 --> 01:29:56,924
Be practical, Hardy.

1017
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:58,889
He'll only fail again.

1018
01:30:00,200 --> 01:30:02,441
Not with your help, he won't.

1019
01:30:04,200 --> 01:30:06,123
Besides, there is another way.

1020
01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:07,925
If he was a...

1021
01:30:08,840 --> 01:30:10,729
If he had a Royal Fellowship...

1022
01:30:10,840 --> 01:30:12,604
An FRS?

1023
01:30:12,680 --> 01:30:14,125
He's Indian!

1024
01:30:18,320 --> 01:30:21,005
MacMahon, listen to me.

1025
01:30:22,160 --> 01:30:24,003
He really needs this.

1026
01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:30,645
See that this gets
to Lieutenant Littlewood.

1027
01:30:30,720 --> 01:30:33,326
Littlewood? Where?

1028
01:30:35,360 --> 01:30:37,442
Mr. Hobson, Mr. Baker, I have someone

1029
01:30:37,520 --> 01:30:39,841
who wishes to talk to you
about Mr. Ramanujan.

1030
01:30:42,080 --> 01:30:43,411
Gentlemen.

1031
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:50,289
Trinity denied him.

1032
01:30:50,760 --> 01:30:53,684
I just want the opportunity
to make the case.

1033
01:30:54,600 --> 01:30:57,126
Try him on his merits.

1034
01:30:57,520 --> 01:31:01,570
Suit yourself. But I think you'll find
the result will be the same.

1035
01:31:09,280 --> 01:31:11,248
- Hardy.
- Morning.

1036
01:31:13,880 --> 01:31:16,486
Now what have you got
yourself involved with?

1037
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:21,206
John.

1038
01:31:23,160 --> 01:31:24,889
Good of you to come.

1039
01:31:25,360 --> 01:31:27,203
Wouldn't have missed it for the world.

1040
01:31:29,160 --> 01:31:32,562
So, now we see the work on partitions

1041
01:31:32,640 --> 01:31:36,770
and the enormous breakthrough
that has been achieved.

1042
01:31:37,960 --> 01:31:39,685
All this, mind you,

1043
01:31:39,760 --> 01:31:42,604
by a man whose limitations
of knowledge when I met him

1044
01:31:42,680 --> 01:31:45,889
were as startling as was its profundity.

1045
01:31:46,840 --> 01:31:51,323
Opinions may differ as to
the importance of Ramanujan's work

1046
01:31:51,440 --> 01:31:55,001
and the influence it may or may not
have on the mathematics of the future,

1047
01:31:55,080 --> 01:32:01,486
but one gift it does show is
its profound and invincible originality.

1048
01:32:03,520 --> 01:32:05,443
Mr. Littlewood once told me

1049
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:11,323
that "every positive integer is
one of Ramanujan's personal friends."

1050
01:32:12,640 --> 01:32:13,880
I believe this to be true.

1051
01:32:13,960 --> 01:32:17,965
He told me that an equation for him
had no meaning

1052
01:32:18,120 --> 01:32:21,522
unless it expressed a thought of God.

1053
01:32:23,120 --> 01:32:28,126
Well, despite everything in my being
set to the contrary,

1054
01:32:28,720 --> 01:32:30,131
perhaps he is right.

1055
01:32:30,920 --> 01:32:36,051
For is this not exactly our justification
for pure mathematics?

1056
01:32:37,280 --> 01:32:42,889
We are merely explorers of infinity
in the pursuit of absolute perfection.

1057
01:32:43,960 --> 01:32:47,362
We do not invent these formulae,
they already exist

1058
01:32:48,040 --> 01:32:52,443
and lie in wait for only the very
brightest of minds, like Ramanujan, ever

1059
01:32:52,520 --> 01:32:55,126
to divine and prove.

1060
01:32:55,840 --> 01:33:00,721
So, in the end,
I have been forced to consider,

1061
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:05,891
who are we to question Ramanujan,

1062
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:11,090
let alone God?

1063
01:33:15,520 --> 01:33:16,726
Thank you.

1064
01:33:39,480 --> 01:33:42,609
It's bad enough that this charlatan
has wasted our time once.

1065
01:33:42,720 --> 01:33:45,365
And now Hardy has dragged
the only person in the world

1066
01:33:45,440 --> 01:33:47,283
who will support him out of the trenches.

1067
01:33:47,360 --> 01:33:50,569
No, enough is enough with this...
This Ramujin.

1068
01:33:51,080 --> 01:33:53,685
Littlewood is not the only one.

1069
01:33:53,760 --> 01:33:56,965
I think he has the finest mind
I've seen in my lifetime.

1070
01:33:57,040 --> 01:33:59,122
And his name is Ramanujan.

1071
01:34:09,360 --> 01:34:10,566
Hardy?

1072
01:34:49,480 --> 01:34:51,926
I'm a Fellow of the Royal Society.

1073
01:35:02,960 --> 01:35:04,291
He wrote to me.

1074
01:35:39,720 --> 01:35:40,960
Janaki.

1075
01:35:42,120 --> 01:35:46,170
If you had gone to him,
he would never return.

1076
01:36:02,760 --> 01:36:04,842
Are you really gonna go home?

1077
01:36:05,400 --> 01:36:07,528
War is over. It is time.

1078
01:36:08,520 --> 01:36:13,287
Well, as a Fellow of the Royal Society,
they're gonna be really proud of you.

1079
01:36:13,520 --> 01:36:15,249
- I owe you so much.
- No, no, no.

1080
01:36:16,040 --> 01:36:18,008
It's I who owe you.

1081
01:36:32,520 --> 01:36:34,284
Come on. Come on the grass. You're late.

1082
01:36:34,360 --> 01:36:37,005
But, sir, I can't.
I'm not a Fellow over here.

1083
01:36:37,080 --> 01:36:39,003
Are you sure about that?

1084
01:36:41,640 --> 01:36:45,486
Well, as an FRS, what could they say?

1085
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:03,165
Repeat after me.

1086
01:37:03,240 --> 01:37:06,483
"I, Srinivas Ramanujan,

1087
01:37:07,440 --> 01:37:10,091
"elected Fellow of Trinity College..."

1088
01:37:12,560 --> 01:37:15,245
I, Srinivas Ramanujan,

1089
01:37:17,080 --> 01:37:19,811
elected Fellow of Trinity College...

1090
01:37:28,080 --> 01:37:30,765
Sorry I'm late. Bloody cab driver got lost.

1091
01:37:30,840 --> 01:37:32,444
Should have known from his number.

1092
01:37:32,520 --> 01:37:34,841
- And what was that?
- Rather a dull one.

1093
01:37:34,920 --> 01:37:37,725
- 1729.
- No, Hardy.

1094
01:37:37,800 --> 01:37:40,644
It is a very interesting number.

1095
01:37:40,720 --> 01:37:42,245
It is the smallest number expressible

1096
01:37:42,320 --> 01:37:45,210
as the sum of two cubes
in two different ways.

1097
01:37:47,960 --> 01:37:50,088
Have you notified your family?

1098
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:54,842
- Just not her.
- I don't even know if she got my letter.

1099
01:37:57,640 --> 01:38:01,122
I... I... I'm rather out of my depth
in such affairs, but...

1100
01:38:01,400 --> 01:38:02,970
But I will say this.

1101
01:38:04,360 --> 01:38:07,603
There are no proofs nor underlying laws

1102
01:38:07,680 --> 01:38:10,968
that can determine the outcome
of matters of the heart.

1103
01:38:11,680 --> 01:38:13,489
Of this I'm sure.

1104
01:38:15,480 --> 01:38:18,768
Perhaps when we meet again
you will have such matters of your own.

1105
01:38:19,480 --> 01:38:21,050
Well, perhaps.

1106
01:38:24,560 --> 01:38:26,324
I will miss you, my friend.

1107
01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:31,170
I will miss you.

1108
01:38:40,880 --> 01:38:44,885
So, I want a letter with you
with all your new work, every week.

1109
01:38:45,800 --> 01:38:48,445
And come back to us in a year's time.

1110
01:38:48,520 --> 01:38:49,851
I promise.

1111
01:39:36,960 --> 01:39:38,605
Afternoon post, sir.

1112
01:39:38,680 --> 01:39:40,045
Thank you.

1113
01:39:40,480 --> 01:39:41,641
India.

1114
01:39:44,800 --> 01:39:46,131
At last.

1115
01:39:57,760 --> 01:39:59,603
Is he coming back, sir?

1116
01:40:12,200 --> 01:40:15,522
It is difficult to put into words

1117
01:40:15,600 --> 01:40:19,400
what I owe Ramanujan.

1118
01:40:21,320 --> 01:40:25,245
His originality has been
a constant source of suggestion to me

1119
01:40:25,320 --> 01:40:27,288
ever since I first met him.

1120
01:40:29,600 --> 01:40:31,170
And his death

1121
01:40:35,520 --> 01:40:38,524
is one of the worst blows
I have ever felt.

1122
01:40:42,480 --> 01:40:45,450
But now I say to myself
when I'm depressed,

1123
01:40:45,800 --> 01:40:51,011
and I find myself forced to listen
to tiresome and pompous people,

1124
01:40:52,120 --> 01:40:56,045
"Well, I've done something
you could never have done.

1125
01:40:57,800 --> 01:41:03,921
"I have collaborated
with both Littlewood and Ramanujan

1126
01:41:05,680 --> 01:41:08,126
"on something like equal terms."

01:42:04,120 --> 01:42:05,565
1729.

1130
01:42:06,120 --> 01:42:09,325
